# using the specified variables - convert "num1" into an interger - I will do this by multiplying by 100 to remove the decimal
# convert "num2" into a float - to do this I will divide the value 23 by 2 to create a decimal point
# convert "num3" into a string - I will print num3 as its value 150 by converting it to a string
# and convert "sting1" into an interger  - using the int() function I'll change string1 from a string to an interger - the number 100 in quotations is defined as a string not an interger

num1 = 99.23
num2 = 23
num3 = 150

print(int(num1) * 10)
print(float(num2) / 2)
print(str(num3))
